# ðŸ’° React Treasure Hunt Game

A simple RNG based treasure hunt game using the react framework, and my first solo react project. A small dash of humor and styling add some of my personality, click on question marks to search for "treasure". If you run out of time, or find the spirit, you lose. 

This project taught me much about react props and the use of state.
